	* ChangeLog: added

2009-08-20 (T.S.)

	* src/shtbl.h, src/shtbl.c, src/fc_recv.c: changed API of
	shtblCreate() to match (upcoming) linear-hash table implementation.
	Size is no longer specified as a exponent to 2 but as the
	desired bucket number directly. shtblCreate() rounds up to the
	next power of two internally.
