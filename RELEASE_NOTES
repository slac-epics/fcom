    Till also fixed a bug related to compiling on RHEL5:

  Built with udpComm-R1-3-0
fcom-R1-3-0:
  Addition of new features:
    * fcomDumpBlob() (dump blob contents and statistics to a FILE).
    * Implementation of 'blob sets'. A 'set' is a collection of
      IDs/blobs. A single thread can block execution until new
      data for *all* requested IDs is available.
fcom-R1-2-0:  Built against rtems 4.9.4 and EPICS BASE:
              base-R3-14-8-2-lcls6
fcom-R1-1-0:
  Added 'fcomDumpIDStats()' which could be a useful diagnostic.
  A linux-host application 'fcget' was added which makes use
  of fcomDumpIDStats on linux (can get + dump individual blobs
  from linux).
  On RTEMS, fcomDumpIDStats() can be used directly. The new
  routine is documented in the fcom_api.h header and the ICD.
fcom-R1-0-0:  
  IMPORTANT BUGFIX RELEASE (affecting only sender):
  Sending data might result in memory corruption.

fcom-R0-1-1:  Built against rtems 4.9.3 and EPICS BASE:
              base-R3-14-8-2-lcls5
              Here we are just tagging a prodcution release
              for testing


  Migrated to use 'udpComm' module. Decision whether to use 
  udpComm/lanIpBasic or udpComm/BSD is up to the application
  developer (see README).
Fcom-R0-1-0:
  Initial, experimental release. Only supports communication over
  'regular' TCP/IP so far but that is transparent to the user.
