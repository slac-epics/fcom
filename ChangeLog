2010-03-21 (T.S.)

	* src/fc_recv.c:
	 o implemented support for 'blob sets' (THIS FEATURE REQUIRES PTHREADS)
	   which allows a single thread to block for arrival of a set of blobs.

	 o BUGFIX: fixed a few places where a negative errno status was passed
	   to FCOM_ERR_SYS(errno). This macro expects a positive error status.

	 o added new (internal) routine to compute condvar timeouts. This now
	   uses clock_gettime() if available (testing _POSIX_TIMERS macro) and
	   falls back on gettimeofday() otherwise.

	 o added fcomDumpBlob() (factored most code out of fcomDumpIDStats() and
	   made the latter a wrapper around fcomDumpBlob()).

2010-03-21 (T.S.)

	* src/xdr_swpP.h: recognize __ppc__ (OSX). Added check and #error
	if neither __LITTLE_ENDIAN__ nor __BIG_ENDIAN__ is defined and
	architecture is not explicitly recognized.

2010-03-21 (T.S.)

	* src/fcomxtst.c, src/fcomrtst.c, src/fcometst.c, src/fcomitst.c:
	Check FCOM_MC_PREFIX environment variable and pass to fcomInit() if set.

	* src/fcomxtst.c: print message indicating that there might be syntax errors
	if scanning a line of input file fails.

2010-03-21 (T.S.)

	* src/fcomrtst.c: Include <unistd.h> for getopts on OSX.

2010-03-21 (T.S.)

	* src/fc_strerror.c: Added description string for new error code FCOM_ERR_ID_IN_USE.

2010-03-21 (T.S.)

	* src/blobio.c: Added short description of file format to header.

2010-03-21 (T.S.)

	* icd/fcom_api.h:
	 o include <inttypes.h> and define format string (FCOM_ID_FMT) for printing IDs.
	 o added new error code FCOM_ERR_ID_IN_USE.
	 o added declaration of new fcomDumpBlob() entry point (identical to
	   fcomDumpIDStats() but a given blob handle may be passed instead of an ID
	   thus avoiding a lookup).
	 o added API declaration of new 'blob set' feature which allows a single thread
	   to block for arrival of a set of blobs.

2010-03-21 (T.S.)

	* src/Makefile: made test programs PROD_HOST instead of PROD_Linux.

2010-03-19 (T.S.)

	* src/fc_init.c, src/fc_recv.c, src/fcomP.h:
	Added 'fcom_silent_mode' to suppress warnings about non-RT scheduler
	and mutex priority inheritance not being available.
	Certain (diagnostic) applications don't care.
	However, this is not a public feature for now.

2010-03-19 (T.S.)

	* src/fcget.c: Added '-i' swith / FCOM_MC_IFADDR env-var to
	define interface where we should listen for FCOM

2010-03-19 (T.S.)

	* src/fcometst.c, src/prototst.c, src/mainwrap.h: Moved
	wrapper code (convert vararg list of strings to proper array
	that can be passed to a 'main'-style routine) to 'mainwrap.h'
	to be used by multiple test programs.

2010-03-19 (T.S.)

	* src/Makefile, src/fcget.c: New host diagnostic/test
	program for reading data from FCOM.

2010-03-19 (T.S.)

	* src/fc_recv.c, icd/fcom_icd.tex, icd/fcom_api.h: Added
	'fcomDumpIDStats()' diagnostic routine and documented in
	the ICD.

2010-03-18 (T.S.)

	* src/mainwrap.h, src/prototst.c, src/fcomrtst.c: separated
	wrapper around 'main' for RTEMS into separate header that
	can be used by different utilites.

	* src/fcomrtst.c: added more command line options/features.

	* src/fcomitst.c, src/Makefile: added 'fcomitst' test program
	for interactive operation.

2010-03-17 (T.S.)

	* src/xdr_enc.c:
	BUGFIX: PPC dcbz optimization cleared source memory instead
	of destination.

2010-01-27 (T.S.)

	* src/Makefile, src/fcom_iocsh.c, src/fcomIocshSupport.dbd: 
	The latter two are new files used to implement a library
	'libfcomIocshSupport' that registers (so far)
	 o fcomInit()
	 o fcomDumpStats()
	 o fcomStrerror()
	with iocsh().

2010-01-27 (T.S.)

	* src/fc_send.c: BUGFIX: check for version number embedded in
	ID (fcomAllocGroup()) used the wrong macros (letting fcomAllocGroup()
	fail).

2010-01-13 (T.S.)

	* src/fcometst.c:
	  o fcomPingBlob() - check return status of fcomPutBlob()
	    and notify the user of errors.
	  o fcomPingBlob() - added note about the inherent race condition
	    (on slow machines).
	  o BUGFIX: call fromInit() in all cases with a nonzero number of
	    buffers (RX is always used!).
	  o Added 'sleep()' after fcomSubscribe() to give the subscription
	    process and the switch(es) some time before starting the real test.

2010-01-13 (T.S.)

	* src/prototst.c: newlib/rtems-4.10 must now #define __need_getopt_newlib
	in order to get declarations for getopt_r().

2010-01-13 (T.S.)

	* src/fc_send.c, src/fc_recv.c: added (compile-time optional) code for
	profiling/timing.

2010-01-13 (T.S.)

	* configure/RELEASE, src/Makefile: use new 'udpComm' module. Since
	this has now a binary-compatible ABI we no longer have to build
	two versions of FCOM (udpComm vs. udpCommBSD) - simply link against
	the udpComm variant you want.

2010-01-13 (T.S.)

	* src/fc_recv.c: avoid type-punning of pointer by making 'pld'
	member of 'Buf' a FcomBlob.

2009-11-12 (T.S.)

	* icd/fcom_api.h: Completed missing comment.

2009-11-12 (T.S.)

	* src/fc_send.c: Check ID version number in fcomAllocGroup().

2009-11-12 (T.S.)

	* icd/fcom_api.h: Fixed bug in example (pointer to data area needs
	to be set.

	Added FCOM_ID_NONE definition.

2009-11-12 (T.S.)
	* src/fc_init.c: fcom_exit() must reset fcom_rsd to -1.

2009-09-14 (T.S.)
	* src/fc_init.c: replaced inet_pton() by inet_aton(). Unfortunately,
	we need an ugly hack (rtems 4.9.2) to make inet_aton() declaration 
	visible in <arpa/inet.h>.

2009-09-14 (T.S.)
	* src/fc_recv.c, src/fc_send.c: include <netinet/in.h> (for
	htonl & friends).

2009-09-14 (T.S.)

	* src/shtbl.h, src/shtbl.c: added shtblFindAdd().

2009-08-20 (T.S.)

	* src/shtbl.h, src/shtbl.c, src/fc_recv.c: changed API of
	shtblDestroy(): 'cleanup' callback is now passed a 'closure'
	pointer.

2009-08-20 (T.S.)

	* ChangeLog: added

2009-08-20 (T.S.)

	* src/shtbl.h, src/shtbl.c, src/fc_recv.c: changed API of
	shtblCreate() to match (upcoming) linear-hash table implementation.
	Size is no longer specified as a exponent to 2 but as the
	desired bucket number directly. shtblCreate() rounds up to the
	next power of two internally.
