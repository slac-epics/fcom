2009-09-14 (T.S.)
	* src/fc_init.c: replaced inet_pton() by inet_aton(). Unfortunately,
	we need an ugly hack (rtems 4.9.2) to make inet_aton() declaration 
	visible in <arpa/inet.h>.

2009-09-14 (T.S.)
	* src/fc_recv.c, src/fc_send.c: include <netinet/in.h> (for
	htonl & friends).

2009-09-14 (T.S.)

	* src/shtbl.h, src/shtbl.c: added shtblFindAdd().

2009-08-20 (T.S.)

	* src/shtbl.h, src/shtbl.c, src/fc_recv.c: changed API of
	shtblDestroy(): 'cleanup' callback is now passed a 'closure'
	pointer.

	* ChangeLog: added

2009-08-20 (T.S.)

	* src/shtbl.h, src/shtbl.c, src/fc_recv.c: changed API of
	shtblCreate() to match (upcoming) linear-hash table implementation.
	Size is no longer specified as a exponent to 2 but as the
	desired bucket number directly. shtblCreate() rounds up to the
	next power of two internally.
