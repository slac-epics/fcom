fcom-R0-1-1:  Built against rtems 4.9.3 and EPICS BASE:
              base-R3-14-8-2-lcls5
              Here we are just tagging a prodcution release
              for testing


  Migrated to use 'udpComm' module. Decision whether to use 
  udpComm/lanIpBasic or udpComm/BSD is up to the application
  developer (see README).
Fcom-R0-1-0:
  Initial, experimental release. Only supports communication over
  'regular' TCP/IP so far but that is transparent to the user.
