2010-01-27 (T.S.)

	* src/Makefile, src/fcom_iocsh.c, src/fcomIocshSupport.dbd: 
	The latter two are new files used to implement a library
	'libfcomIocshSupport' that registers (so far)
	 o fcomInit()
	 o fcomDumpStats()
	 o fcomStrerror()
	with iocsh().

2010-01-27 (T.S.)

	* src/fc_send.c: BUGFIX: check for version number embedded in
	ID (fcomAllocGroup()) used the wrong macros (letting fcomAllocGroup()
	fail).

2010-01-13 (T.S.)

	* src/fcometst.c:
	  o fcomPingBlob() - check return status of fcomPutBlob()
	    and notify the user of errors.
	  o fcomPingBlob() - added note about the inherent race condition
	    (on slow machines).
	  o BUGFIX: call fromInit() in all cases with a nonzero number of
	    buffers (RX is always used!).
	  o Added 'sleep()' after fcomSubscribe() to give the subscription
	    process and the switch(es) some time before starting the real test.

2010-01-13 (T.S.)

	* src/prototst.c: newlib/rtems-4.10 must now #define __need_getopt_newlib
	in order to get declarations for getopt_r().

2010-01-13 (T.S.)

	* src/fc_send.c, src/fc_recv.c: added (compile-time optional) code for
	profiling/timing.

2010-01-13 (T.S.)

	* configure/RELEASE, src/Makefile: use new 'udpComm' module. Since
	this has now a binary-compatible ABI we no longer have to build
	two versions of FCOM (udpComm vs. udpCommBSD) - simply link against
	the udpComm variant you want.

2010-01-13 (T.S.)

	* src/fc_recv.c: avoid type-punning of pointer by making 'pld'
	member of 'Buf' a FcomBlob.

2009-11-12 (T.S.)

	* icd/fcom_api.h: Completed missing comment.

2009-11-12 (T.S.)

	* src/fc_send.c: Check ID version number in fcomAllocGroup().

2009-11-12 (T.S.)

	* icd/fcom_api.h: Fixed bug in example (pointer to data area needs
	to be set.

	Added FCOM_ID_NONE definition.

2009-11-12 (T.S.)
	* src/fc_init.c: fcom_exit() must reset fcom_rsd to -1.

2009-09-14 (T.S.)
	* src/fc_init.c: replaced inet_pton() by inet_aton(). Unfortunately,
	we need an ugly hack (rtems 4.9.2) to make inet_aton() declaration 
	visible in <arpa/inet.h>.

2009-09-14 (T.S.)
	* src/fc_recv.c, src/fc_send.c: include <netinet/in.h> (for
	htonl & friends).

2009-09-14 (T.S.)

	* src/shtbl.h, src/shtbl.c: added shtblFindAdd().

2009-08-20 (T.S.)

	* src/shtbl.h, src/shtbl.c, src/fc_recv.c: changed API of
	shtblDestroy(): 'cleanup' callback is now passed a 'closure'
	pointer.

2009-08-20 (T.S.)

	* ChangeLog: added

2009-08-20 (T.S.)

	* src/shtbl.h, src/shtbl.c, src/fc_recv.c: changed API of
	shtblCreate() to match (upcoming) linear-hash table implementation.
	Size is no longer specified as a exponent to 2 but as the
	desired bucket number directly. shtblCreate() rounds up to the
	next power of two internally.
